Steps before a release is done
------------------------------

Edit the ``version.txt`` file properly, then tag and commit/push

  git tag release-VERSION
  git commit -am "Release VERSION"
  git push --tag


How to release it to PyPI
-------------------------

Dead simple:

    ./setup.py sdist upload


How to create a .deb
--------------------

WARNING: this creation is actually using sudo and messing with your system; it shouldn't (checkinstall should be called with no sudo but fakereoot before it, and with --fstrans parameter), but I wasn't able to make it work.

Before starting checkinstall, do this so it gets the description automatically:

    python3 setup.py --long-description > description-pak


The following is the whole command (copy it, trim the comments, put everything in the same line):

    sudo checkinstall
        --install=no                               # don't install the .deb created
        --pkgname=fades                            # package name
        --pkgversion=`cat version.txt`             # automatically get the real version
        --requires=python3                         # only dependency
        --maintainer=facundo@taniquetil.com.ar     # maintainer contact
        --deldoc=yes --deldesc=yes --delspec=yes   # some cleanup
        --backup=no                                # don't save a backup file
        -D                                         # create the .deb
        -y                                         # yes, yes to all
        python3 ./setup.py install --prefix=/usr   # the installation command


This will leave some dirt behind, clean it:

    sudo rm -r /usr/share/fades/ /usr/bin/fades
    sudo rm -r build fades.egg-info description-pak


It also should leave you a .deb in the same directory. Change its permission and rename properly

    sudo chown $USER: *.deb
    mv *.deb fades-`cat version.txt`.deb


To test the .deb you just created:

    sudo dpkg i *.deb


If you want to uninstall it do:

    sudo dpkg -r fades


How to release it to Arch
-------------------------

    Edit ``pkg/archlinux/PKGBUILD`` and set *pkgver* and *md5sums*, then run *makepkg -S* inside 
    the same directory that PKGBUILD. It will generate a file named 'fades-X.X-X.src.tar.gz'. 
    Finally submit this file at the AUR page.
