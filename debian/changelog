fades (4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New option to use iPython as the interactive interpreter: --ipython
    (thanks Ariel Rossanigo).

  * Now it's possible to execute a program inside the virtualenv, with -x
    (thanks Ricardo Kirkner).

  * Can execute fades as a Python's module (thanks Javi Mansilla)

  * Dependencies can be specified in docstrings

  * Support using Python 3.3 to run fades

  * Better parsing of docstring to detect dependencies

  * If you want to fiddle with lower layers options, can send parameters
    to virtualend or pip.

  * We have a logo!

  * Now we run the fades tests using fades itself, no need to install
    anything previously

  * Other minor bugfixes and improvements
