    As fades is a program that executes programs, at first there is the
    complexity of deciding which of the parameters are for fades and which
    ones are for the executed child program. For this, we decided that after
    fades itself, everything starting with a "-" is a parameter for fade,
    then the rest is for child program.

    Also, it happens that if you pass several parameters to fades when
    calling it using the "!#/usr/bin/fades" magic at the beginning of a file,
    all the parameters you put there come as a single string.
